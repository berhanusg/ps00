;quadratic root : nonzeroReal Number, Real Number, Real Number   -> Real Numbers
    ; GIVEN: a quadratic equation of the form a(x squared) +bx + c 
    ; RETURNS: the square root  of the equation
    ; Examples:
    ; quadratic root  3 10  8 => 2/3 
    ; quadratic root  1 8 15 => -2/3
;Divide and conquer

;(+ -10 ( sqrt (-( * 10  10) ( * (* 4 3 ) 8))))

; (/ (+ -10 ( sqrt (-( * 10  10) ( * (* 4 3 ) 8))))(* 2 3))
